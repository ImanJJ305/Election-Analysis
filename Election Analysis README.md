## Election-Audit Summary

I believe this script should be used to better automate and facilitate the vote calculation process for future elections. You'll want to change the CSV file path in order to pull different souces of data for future elections. If this is used in the future you can also include addtional sets of code to pull other data regarding the demogrpahic that voted, like race or gender, to get a better understanding of who the voting citizens are.
